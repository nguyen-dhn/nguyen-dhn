My name is Nguyen. I'm based in Danang. I mainly use Python as my primary programming language.

I work as an AI Engineer at FTECH.AI. I have two-year exp in Computer Vision / ML / Deep Learning (basically). Now, I'm learning more about deploying, scaling, optimizing, and monitoring AI applications in production (preferred as MLOps) using technologies and concepts like:

- Docker (docker-compose)
- Task Queue (Celery)
- Asyncio / Multiprocessing / Multithreading
- Message Broker (RabbitMQ, Redis)
- REST (FastAPI)
- Triton Inference Server
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Flower)
- Database (Postgres, MongoDB) 
- Infrastructure as Code
