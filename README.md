My name is Nguyen. I'm based in Danang. I mainly use Python as my primary programming language.

I work as an AI Engineer and also a Team Leader at FTECH.AI. I have three-year exp in Computer Vision / ML / Deep Learning (basically). Now, I'm learning more about deploying, scaling, optimizing, and monitoring AI applications in production (preferred as MLOps).
